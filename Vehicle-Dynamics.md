## Vehicle Dynamics


![vehicle-forces](/pictures/vehicle-dynamics/vehicle-dynamics.PNG "vehicle forces")


- **Weight**: Defined by the car, constant. Always pointing towards the center of the Earth.


- **Support (Normal)**: Force provided by the ground to the car, equal to the Weight. Always perpendicular to the ground.


- **Traction**: Force provided by the engine of the car through the motion of the wheels.


- **Drag (Resistance)**: Aerodynamic decelerating force by the air flowing around the car. It increases with the speed of the car (D ~ V^2).



### Newton's 1st Law

- If a body is at rest or moving at a constant speed, it will remain at rest or keep moving at constant speed unless it is acted upon by a force.


### Newton's 2nd Law

- An unbalanced force acting on a body will produce an acceleration to such body in the direction of the force in accordance to its mass.

- In other words: Force equals mass multiplied by acceleration.

- The sigma sign here means **summation**, meaning the sum of all forces.


![with-sigma](/pictures/vehicle-dynamics/with-sigma.PNG "with sigma")


- If all the forces are not balanced, that would imply an acceleration in the direction of the resulting forces. And to combine all forces, we simply put the sigma over there, which means the compound of all forces.

- **Weight**: Constant, vertical.


- **Normal**: Force provided by the ground to the car, perpendicular to the ground.


- **Centripetal force**: Inertial force due to car's opposing change of direction.


- **Cornering force**: Force produced by a vehicle tire during cornering.

- **Negative camber**: Increased handling during heavy cornering.


- **Zero camber**: Most uniform tire wear over time.


- **Positive camber**: Reduced steering effort, greater stability.


- Generally, sports cars prefer to have **negative camber** in order to improve the cornering response, effectiveness, and performance, while also adding a touch of instability in the straight line. Clearly, this is similar to what a sports car might be intended to perform. 


- On the other hand, **positive camber** is quite common for agricultural vehicles, especially when terrain is irregular. This will aid when steering the vehicle due to its improved steering performance and adaptability to the terrain. 


### Pure rotation and pure translation = Rolling motion

- Addition of pure rotation and pure translation is rolling motion.


![pure-rotation-and-pure-translation](/pictures/vehicle-dynamics/pure-rotation-and-pure-translation.PNG "pure rotation and pure translation")


- In order for the velocity at point P to be equal to zero, we must have that **pure rotation** and **pure translation** velocities at point P must be equal to zero.


- In other words, the velocity of the rotation and the velocity of the translation **must be equal at the point P** so that the wheel does not slip. This then results in the fact that the velocity at which the vehicle will be moving.
