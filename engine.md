## Vehicle Engine

- As you know, a car can generate from within a **traction force** which is capable of pushing it forward.


- A storage of chemical energy is transformed to mechanical energy through combustion. And finally, the high pressure and combustion result in a **dense and explosive output of energy**. 


- Petrol engine and diesel engine. These are **four stroke engines**, which operate with the duration and rotation of the piston. And also the combination of pressure and high temperature which result in a dense and explosive output of energy.

- Let us start by making a brief description of the chemical reaction which is happening inside of an engine.


- So, what we actually have in any type of reaction is a certain amount of **reactants**, in this case, fuel and oxygen, and a certain amount of products, which are the result of the combination. 


- The idea is that we will be able to convert fuel and oxygen into carbon dioxide and water.

- A **hydrocarbon** is a molecular compound which contains both hydrogen and carbon. So, fuel is a hydrocarbon, meaning that it contains a certain amount of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms. And oxygen can be easily found on the surrounding of the car through the air. 


- And by doing this, we end up with products, which are carbon dioxide and water.


**Octane Petrol**

- Petrol uses what is known as Octane, its name is **C8H18**. And diesel is **C12H23**.


```
# Octane Petrol (C8H18):
2 C8H18 + 25 O2 => 16 CO2 + 18 H20

# Diesel (C12H23):
4 C12H23 + 71 O2 => 48 CO2 + 46 H20
```

### 2 Stroke Engine vs. 4 Stroke Engine

- The fundamental difference between the 2 stroke engine and the 4 stroke engine is that the 2 stroke engine cannot actually produce as much force or as much torque as the four stroke engine. 


- And the reason why we discuss 2 stroke engine is because of the fact that the operation is simple and effective. 


![2-stroke-engine-and-4-stroke-engine](/pictures/engine/2-stroke-engine-and-4-stroke-engine.PNG "2 stroke engine vs. 4 stroke engine")


- Compression stroke means that the piston of an engine will move upwards and will compress at high pressure and high temperature.


- The mixture, which is the **fuel and oxygen combined** in a very small volume, will explode in the petrol engine with an igniter, which will produce an additional amount of heat to the mixture.  


![2-stroke-engine](/pictures/engine/2-stroke-engine.PNG "2 stroke engine")


- But in the 2 stroke engine, how does the piston move upwards? The idea here is the **crankshaft**. The momentum of the crankshaft will move the piston upwards again **as a consequence of the inertia**.


- The mass of the crankshaft rotating at a certain speed will keep on rotating unless there's a force applied to it. So, what will happen is that the pison will naturally move up as a consequence of rotating intertia of the crankshaft. 


- So, what about a 4 stroke engine? 


![four-stroke-engine](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/d/images/a/a6/4-Stroke-Engine.gif)


- In the 4 stroke engine, we can actually achieve 2 times the movement of the 2 stroke engine. And this implies 2 stroke engine has a substantial advantage in terms of fuel consumption, in the sense that the same output of mechanical energy is produced with **only half the amount of strokes**.


![engine-components](/pictures/engine/engine-components.PNG "engine components")


- In the first stroke, we need to allow the fuel mixture to get inside. So the valves must move accordingly in order to provide the first stroke, letting the mixture into the combustion chamber. 


- Whereas, in the fourth stroke, the valve must move to allow the mixture to get outside of the chamber. So, what we have is a **perfectly coordinated rotation that must take place between the valves and the crankshaft**. Because the movement of crankshaft is directly linked to the movement of the piston. 


- So, what we need to literally do is to **time the rotation of the valves with respect to the crankshaft** by connecting them with **timing belt or timing chain**.

![rotating-camshaft](https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/2/27/EccentricCam.gif)


- In addition, the way we provide the movement to the valves is through the **camshaft**.  The idea is that the continuously rotating camshaft produces a linear motion.


![engine-flywheel](/pictures/engine/engine-flywheel.PNG "engine flywheel")


- Flywheel is located on one side of the engine. The crankshaft allows for the pistons to move as a consequence of their momentum. But we can actually balnce all of the momentum of the crankshaft and make it a bit more stable and also provide a higher momentum by literally putting a flywheel on one side. 


- And engine block is simply the metallic protective element, which allows the fuel to get inside of the engine.
