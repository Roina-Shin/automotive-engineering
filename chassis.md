## Materials & Mechanical Properties

- We will start by making an introduction to **Young's Modulus**. This is a very important concept to understand if you are interested in materials of vehicles.


- First of all, how do we evaluate the strength of a material? And one of the first practices in engineering is that you can do a lot of tests to a given material and they provide results which resemble each other.


- And one of the easiest concept of tests in order to understand the material strength is what is known as the **tensile strength**.


- First, we take an element or a component of a car. And what would happen if we were to take this section and apply what is known as a tensile strength?


- In other words, what would be the tensile strength of this material? And what we see clearly and intuitively here is that if we apply a force to the given material, it will actually and substantially **elongate as a consequence of the force**.


- If we apply a force, and if it almost does not elongate, it means that the material has a high strength. However, if the material starts elongating, even if we apply a relatively small force, the material would have a less strength.


![tensile-strength-test](/pictures/chassis/tensile-strength.PNG "tensile strength")


- But if we do not apply the force, it will come back to its initial size. This is an exact definition of an **elastic type of deformation** in which when a force is applied, the elongation occurs. But when you stop applying the force, the material goes down to the same dimension as initially.


- **Strain** is simply defined as the elongation. The elongation will simply be **l1- l0**. And the strain is calculated by **(l1 - l0) / l0**. It is simply expressed as a value between 0 and 1. 


![engineering-strain](/pictures/chassis/engineering-strain.PNG "engineering strain")


- And **stress** is the **F (Force) / A (Cross Section)**. 


![stress-definition](/pictures/chassis/stress-definition.PNG "stress definition")


```
strain (~ elongation)

stress (~ force)
```

- So, the elongation will **grow proportionally** to the force applied.


![correlation-stress-and-strain](/pictures/chassis/correlation-strain-and-stress.PNG "correlation between strain and stress")


- Young's Modulus is very useful because by doing this simple test, we can **evaluate the mechanical properties of a given material**.


- However, when we are applying a very high force, the material will behave or will start to deform **elastically**, meaning that the structure of the material will actually change. So, as a consequence of that, when we arrive to a so called **Yield Strength**, the material will start to deform elastically.


![yield-strenth](/pictures/chassis/yield-strength.PNG "yield strength")


- So, after that yeild strength point, the mateiral will literally start to yield. And if we continue to do the test, we will find the **ultimate strength**, meaning the highest amount of stress that will be tolerated. 


- But, from that point on, the material will increasingly be able to tolerate less stress and will fracture as a consequence.


- And steel has a very high value of **Young's Modulus**. One of the methods to choose the best materials for automotive applications is to use **a material selection chart**.


![automotive-material-selection-chart](/pictures/chassis/material-selection-chart.PNG "material selection chart")


- Also, due to legislative and consumer demands for lightweight, fuel-efficient vehicles, the use of lightweight and composite materials in the automotive industry has been increasing in recent years.


## Axles

- Weight of the car and loads are tranferred to the ground through the wheels. So, the wheels are the interaction between the ground and the car.


- The wheels are connected to the vehicle through **the axles**. This is where the axles become a very relevant component. They are the way in which the wheels will transmit the energy to the car itself.


- So, the axles are also **the key to transmitting acceleration and braking forces to the wheels**.


![vehicle-axles](/pictures/chassis/wheel-axles.PNG "vehicle axles")


- But most importantly, the axles must be capable of supporting and withstanding the loads of the car.


- As a result, two types of axles can be defined. The first one would be the **drive axle**, which fundamentally, takes into account **the transmission power** from the driveshaft through the **differential** right to the wheels.


![drive-axle-and-driveshaft](/pictures/chassis/drive-axle-and-driveshaft.PNG "drive axle and driveshaft")


- And the second one is **dead axle** in which no transmission power is required, but rather only structural demands are fulfilled. So, the dead axle will be a structural component that unites the 2 wheels.


![dead-axle](/pictures/chassis/dead-axle.PNG "dead axle")



## Front Axle and Rear Axle

![front-and-rear-axles](/pictures/chassis/front-axle-and-rear-axle.PNG "front axle and rear axle")


- Now, let's make a brief distinction between a front axle and a rear axle. The difference between a front and rear axles can be described as the difference between a drive and dead axles.


- The front axle must carry the front weight. And the front axle usually facilitates the steering of a car. Because the steering is provided to the front axle.


- The rear axle will transmit the power (from differential) to driving wheels. And the differential transmits the energy from the engine towards the axle.


## Semi Floating Axle vs. Full Floating Axle

- **Full floating axles** are only subjected to torsional loads. Whereas, in the case of **semi floating axles** are subjected to torsional but also shear stress.


![full-floating-and-semi-floating-axles](/pictures/chassis/semi-floating-axle-vs-full-floating-axle.PNG "semi floating axle vs. full floating axle")


- **Semi-floating axles** are both lighter in weight and cheaper to manufacture than full floating axles. Though they have a limited load capacity, so they are the axle of choice in light duty vehicles, including mid-size and small pickup trucks, and so on.


- In the case of **full floating axles**, they consis of a **wheel hub**, an assemble that is separate from the axle shaft.


- And a **spindle** bolted to the axle tube supports the wheel hub **by means of a pair of wheel bearings**. Therefore, the weight of the vehicleand its cargo is transferred to the axle tube rather than the axle shaft itself. As a result, **a full floating axle shaft** is not subjected to the bending moment or shear force that a semi-floating axle is.


- Rather, the axle shaft's only task is to transmit power to the wheel hub. As a result, the shaft is only subjected to torsional loads.


- The full floating axles are rather heavy, but they have a very large weight carrying capacity. They are pretty common in heavy trucks.


- The main idea of **bearing** is to connect an axle tube and the rotating shaft. That is where the concept of bearings come. Bearings are used to connect **2 circular or cylindrical components**.


![axle-bearings](/pictures/chassis/axle-bearings.PNG "axle bearings")


- So, without the bearings, there would be clearly a difficult way to connect the shaft and the axle tube and also transmit the forces within. 


## Components

### Brakes

- As you know, **brakes** are fundamentally required to immediately **slow down** the speed of the car.


- A brake system will act on the wheels according to the brake pedal, operated by the driver.


- The brake system must be designed to be durable, reliable and cost-effective.


![automotive-braking-system](/pictures/chassis/automotive-braking-system.PNG "automotive braking system")


- One of the key things that you have to take into account when considering the design of either **a disc or drum break** is also the influence of the whole system, and particularly with **a hydraulic system**.


- Clearly, in order to operate the brakes on the wheels of the car, we must do it by pushing the pedal. And so pushing the pedal implies that **we will be moving fluid, in this case, hydraulic oil**. 


- And this oil will move from the **master cylinder** and will move towards the brakes. And the way in which the fluid is capable of influencing the way in which the car brakes is exactly how the brake and the drum brake operate. 


- So, clearly, the **hydraulic system** is a key element to the operation of braking system.


### Disc Brakes

- Let's talk about the disc brake. The concept of disc brake is that by pushing the pedal, we are allowing the oil in the brake fluid reservoir to move towards the so-called **brake caliper pistons**.


![brake-caliper-pistons](/pictures/chassis/brake-caliper-piston.PNG "brake caliper piston")


![hydraulic-disc-brake-system](/pictures/chassis/hydraulic-disc-brake-system.PNG "hydraulic disc brake system")


- So, as a consequence of the increase in fluid, this fluid will actually push the pistons towards the disc, which is located at the center of two brake pads.


- In other words, by applying a force of friction, we are capable of braking. And the friction is nothing but the increase in temperature between the two surfaces. So, as a consequence of braking, there will be a **heat increase**.


- So, clearly, this type of brake simply uses friction as a way of reducing the rotational speed of the disk, and that impolies a **heat dissipation**.


### Drum Brakes

- Now, the drum brakes are typically found on the rear part of the car. And this is because of the fact that for most cars the front part of the car is more relevant in terms of braking than the rear part of the car. 


- So, disc brakes outperform drum brakes. The idea for **drum brake** is that, on the contrary to disc brake, the force is actually acting from the inside to the exterior.


![drum-brake](/pictures/chassis/drum-brake.PNG "drum brake")


- When we push the pedal, the fluid moves to the inside of the wheel cylinder and this wheel cylinder will then move the components inside of the drum brake.


- And the brake shoes will then be forced as a consequence to interact or pushed towards the drum of the brake.


![disc-brake-vs-drum-brake](/pictures/chassis/disc-brake-vs-drum-brake.PNG "disc brake vs drum brake")


- Actually, the drum brakes are more cost effective to manufacture. So, drum brakes are preferrable for those cars that do not need the performance of the disc brakes.


- Therefore, if you are buying a high performance car, the four wheels will all be with disc brakes. But if you are just buying an average car, it will typically be the case where you have disc brakes on the front and drum brakes on the rear part of the car. So, it really comes down to the cost effectiveness.
