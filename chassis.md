## Materials & Mechanical Properties

- We will start by making an introduction to **Young's Modulus**. This is a very important concept to understand if you are interested in materials of vehicles.


- First of all, how do we evaluate the strength of a material? And one of the first practices in engineering is that you can do a lot of tests to a given material and they provide results which resemble each other.


- And one of the easiest concept of tests in order to understand the material strength is what is known as the **tensile strength**.


- First, we take an element or a component of a car. And what would happen if we were to take this section and apply what is known as a tensile strength?


- In other words, what would be the tensile strength of this material? And what we see clearly and intuitively here is that if we apply a force to the given material, it will actually and substantially **elongate as a consequence of the force**.


- If we apply a force, and if it almost does not elongate, it means that the material has a high strength. However, if the material starts elongating, even if we apply a relatively small force, the material would have a less strength.
