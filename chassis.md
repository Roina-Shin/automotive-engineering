## Materials & Mechanical Properties

- We will start by making an introduction to **Young's Modulus**. This is a very important concept to understand if you are interested in materials of vehicles.


- First of all, how do we evaluate the strength of a material? And one of the first practices in engineering is that you can do a lot of tests to a given material and they provide results which resemble each other.


- And one of the easiest concept of tests in order to understand the material strength is what is known as the **tensile strength**.


- First, we take an element or a component of a car. And what would happen if we were to take this section and apply what is known as a tensile strength?


- In other words, what would be the tensile strength of this material? And what we see clearly and intuitively here is that if we apply a force to the given material, it will actually and substantially **elongate as a consequence of the force**.


- If we apply a force, and if it almost does not elongate, it means that the material has a high strength. However, if the material starts elongating, even if we apply a relatively small force, the material would have a less strength.

- But if we do not apply the force, it will come back to its initial size. This is an exact definition of an **elastic type of deformation** in which when a force is applied, the elongation occurs. But when you stop applying the force, the material goes down to the same dimension as initially.


- **Strain** is simply defined as the elongation. The elongation will simply be **l1- l0**. And the strain is calculated by **(l1 - l0) / l0**. It is simply expressed as a value between 0 and 1.

- And **stress** is the **F (Force) / A (Cross Section)**.

```
strain (~ elongation)

stress (~ force)
```

- So, the elongation will **grow proportionally** to the force applied.

- Young's Modulus is very useful because by doing this simple test, we can **evaluate the mechanical properties of a given material**.


- However, when we are applying a very high force, the material will behave or will start to deform **elastically**, meaning that the structure of the material will actually change. So, as a consequence of that, when we arrive to a so called **Yield Strength**, the material will start to deform elastically.

- So, after that yeild strength point, the mateiral will literally start to yield. And if we continue to do the test, we will find the **ultimate strength**, meaning the highest amount of stress that will be tolerated. 


- But, from that point on, the material will increasingly be able to tolerate less stress and will fracture as a consequence.


- And steel has a very high value of **Young's Modulus**. One of the methods to choose the best materials for automotive applications is to use **a material selection chart**.

- Also, due to legislative and consumer demands for lightweight, fuel-efficient vehicles, the use of lightweight and composite materials in the automotive industry has been increasing in recent years.
