## Materials & Mechanical Properties

- We will start by making an introduction to **Young's Modulus**. This is a very important concept to understand if you are interested in materials of vehicles.


- First of all, how do we evaluate the strength of a material? And one of the first practices in engineering is that you can do a lot of tests to a given material and they provide results which resemble each other.


- And one of the easiest concept of tests in order to understand the material strength is what is known as the **tensile strength**.


- First, we take an element or a component of a car. And what would happen if we were to take this section and apply what is known as a tensile strength?


- In other words, what would be the tensile strength of this material? And what we see clearly and intuitively here is that if we apply a force to the given material, it will actually and substantially **elongate as a consequence of the force**.


- If we apply a force, and if it almost does not elongate, it means that the material has a high strength. However, if the material starts elongating, even if we apply a relatively small force, the material would have a less strength.


![tensile-strength-test](/pictures/chassis/tensile-strength.PNG "tensile strength")


- But if we do not apply the force, it will come back to its initial size. This is an exact definition of an **elastic type of deformation** in which when a force is applied, the elongation occurs. But when you stop applying the force, the material goes down to the same dimension as initially.


- **Strain** is simply defined as the elongation. The elongation will simply be **l1- l0**. And the strain is calculated by **(l1 - l0) / l0**. It is simply expressed as a value between 0 and 1.

- And **stress** is the **F (Force) / A (Cross Section)**. 


![stress-definition](/pictures/chassis/stress-definition.PNG "stress definition")


```
strain (~ elongation)

stress (~ force)
```

- So, the elongation will **grow proportionally** to the force applied.

- Young's Modulus is very useful because by doing this simple test, we can **evaluate the mechanical properties of a given material**.


- However, when we are applying a very high force, the material will behave or will start to deform **elastically**, meaning that the structure of the material will actually change. So, as a consequence of that, when we arrive to a so called **Yield Strength**, the material will start to deform elastically.


![yield-strenth](/pictures/chassis/yield-strength.PNG "yield strength")


- So, after that yeild strength point, the mateiral will literally start to yield. And if we continue to do the test, we will find the **ultimate strength**, meaning the highest amount of stress that will be tolerated. 


- But, from that point on, the material will increasingly be able to tolerate less stress and will fracture as a consequence.


- And steel has a very high value of **Young's Modulus**. One of the methods to choose the best materials for automotive applications is to use **a material selection chart**.


![automotive-material-selection-chart](/pictures/chassis/material-selection-chart.PNG "material selection chart")


- Also, due to legislative and consumer demands for lightweight, fuel-efficient vehicles, the use of lightweight and composite materials in the automotive industry has been increasing in recent years.


## Axles

- Weight of the car and loads are tranferred to the ground through the wheels. So, the wheels are the interaction between the ground and the car.


- The wheels are connected to the vehicle through **the axles**. This is where the axles become a very relevant component. They are the way in which the wheels will transmit the energy to the car itself.


- So, the axles are also **the key to transmitting acceleration and braking forces to the wheels**.


![vehicle-axles](/pictures/chassis/wheel-axles.PNG "vehicle axles")


- But most importantly, the axles must be capable of supporting and withstanding the loads of the car.


- As a result, two types of axles can be defined. The first one would be the **drive axle**, which fundamentally, takes into account **the transmission power** from the driveshaft through the **differential** right to the wheels.


![drive-axle-and-driveshaft](/pictures/chassis/drive-axle-and-driveshaft.PNG "drive axle and driveshaft")


- And the second one is **dead axle** in which no transmission power is required, but rather only structural demands are fulfilled. So, the dead axle will be a structural component that unites the 2 wheels.

## Front Axle and Rear Axle

![front-and-rear-axles](/pictures/chassis/front-axle-and-rear-axle.PNG "front axle and rear axle")


- Now, let's make a brief distinction between a front axle and a rear axle. The difference between a front and rear axles can be described as the difference between a drive and dead axles.


- The front axle must carry the front weight. And the front axle usually facilitates the steering of a car. Because the steering is provided to the front axle.


- The rear axle will transmit the power (from differential) to driving wheels. And the differential transmits the energy from the engine towards the axle.


## Semi Floating Axle vs. Full Floating Axle

- **Full floating axles** are only subjected to torsional loads. Whereas, in the case of **semi floating axles** are subjected to torsional but also shear stress.


![full-floating-and-semi-floating-axles](/pictures/chassis/semi-floating-axle-vs-full-floating-axle.PNG "semi floating axle vs. full floating axle")


- **Semi-floating axles** are both lighter in weight and cheaper to manufacture than full floating axles. Though they have a limited load capacity, so they are the axle of choice in light duty vehicles, including mid-size and small pickup trucks, and so on.


- In the case of **full floating axles**, they consis of a **wheel hub**, an assemble that is separate from the axle shaft.


- And a **spindle** bolted to the axle tube supports the wheel hub **by means of a pair of wheel bearings**. Therefore, the weight of the vehicleand its cargo is transferred to the axle tube rather than the axle shaft itself. As a result, **a full floating axle shaft** is not subjected to the bending moment or shear force that a semi-floating axle is.


- Rather, the axle shaft's only task is to transmit power to the wheel hub. As a result, the shaft is only subjected to torsional loads.


- The full floating axles are rather heavy, but they have a very large weight carrying capacity. They are pretty common in heavy trucks.


- The main idea of **bearing** is to connect an axle tube and the rotating shaft. That is where the concept of bearings come. Bearings are used to connect **2 circular or cylindrical components**.


![axle-bearings](/pictures/chassis/axle-bearings.PNG "axle bearings")


- So, without the bearings, there would be clearly a difficult way to connect the shaft and the axle tube and also transmit the forces within.
